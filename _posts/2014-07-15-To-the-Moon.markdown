description: The main projects of $bSHIBA will be done and we will start scaling these projects. Aside from the main burn-events which will take place, we plan on burning additional tokens by buying $bSHIBA with 50% of all profits generated from the $bSHIBA ecosystem, these tokens will also be burnt in order to reduce the circulating supply tremendously. At this point, anyone can use the products of the $bSHIBA ecosystem. Artists and designers attained in order to close exclusive deals to release their art only on our $bSHIBA NFT marketplace (The $bSHIBA will not only be a Pepe or meme related NFT marketplace).
